Data Visualization in a convenient user-friendly format for viewing Covid-19 data Worldwide

I created basically two functions that takes your preferences as arguments and plot it for you.

Please refer to the last two cells of the notebook, where you can find the examples and comments of usage of "plotar" and "plotmap2" functions.

plotar function takes a list of countries, a type of value you want to compare (e.g. cases, deaths, Sum of deaths etc.) and a scale and plot it for you.

plotmap2 function takes the values you want to plot and the projection (provided in last cell comments).

Feel free to contribute, this is intended to provide quick analyses for people worldwide.

Make sure you have matplotlib, numpy and plotly libraries installed, I made a file with the environment available (.yml) in case you need it.

Data collected from EU database.
